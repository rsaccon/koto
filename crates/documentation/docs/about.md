# About Koto

Koto is a simple and expressive programming language, usable as an extension
language for [Rust][rust] applications, or as a standalone scripting language.

```koto
print 'Hello, World!'
check! Hello, World!

square = |n| n * n
print! '8 squared is {square 8}'
check! 8 squared is 64

print! (2, 4, 6, 8)
  .each square
  .to_list()
check! [4, 16, 36, 64]
```

## Background

Koto was started in 2020 with the goal to create an ideal language for adding
scripting to applications developed in Rust. Of particular interest were
interactive systems like animation or game engines, where rapid iteration
demands a lightweight programming interface that compiles and runs quickly.

The guiding design principle is that Koto should be _simple_,
conceptually as well as visually. To that end, a focus throughout the language's
development has been on reducing syntax noise and minimizing core concepts
wherever possible.

## Current State

Koto is a new language and should be considered to have a prominent
'use at your own risk' disclaimer.

With that said, Koto is starting to feel more stable, and although we're still
some way from a `1.0` release,
breaking changes are becoming much less frequent.

Early adopter feedback is invaluable, so if you do try out Koto please
get in touch and share your experiences, positive or otherwise!
You're welcome to reach out in [Discussions][discussions],
or on [Discord][discord], or by opening an [issue][issues].

You can read [the guide](./language_guide.md),
try it out in [the playground][playground] or
the [CLI](./cli.md), and see how well it works in your
[existing Rust application](./api.md).

## Features

- **Simple and clean syntax:** Koto aims to reduce visual noise and cognitive
  load wherever possible, while still enabling full intuitive control of your
  program.
- **Easy integration with Rust:** Koto is implemented in Rust, and is designed
  to be easily added to existing applications.
  Custom value types can be added to the Koto runtime by implementing the
  [`KotoObject`][koto-object] trait.
- **Fast compilation:** The compiler has been written with rapid iteration in
  mind, with the goal of compiling a script as quickly as possible.
- **Rich iterator support:** Koto has a focus on using iterators for data
  manipulation, with a large collection of iterator generators, adaptors,
  and consumers available in the core library's [iterator module][iterator].
- **Built-in testing:** Automated testing has
  [first-class support in Koto][testing], making it natural to write tests along
  with your code.
- **Optional multi-threaded runtime** By default, Koto has a single-threaded
  runtime. For applications that require multi-threaded scripting,
  a [feature flag][api-multi-threaded] enables a thread-safe runtime.
- **Tooling:** Support for Koto is available for [several popular editors](#editors).
  [Tree-sitter](#tree-sitter) and [LSP](#lsp) implementations are also available.
  Auto-formatting and linting are future topics, contributions are welcome!

### Missing/Incomplete Features

- **Async tasks:** Koto doesn't have support for `async`/`await`-style
  asynchronous tasks, although support [is planned][async] for the future.
- **Integration with other languages:** There's currently no C API for Koto,
  which would allow it to be integrated with languages other than Rust.

## Influences

Koto was influenced by and is indebted to many other languages.
- **Scope:** [Lua][lua] was a strong influence on Koto, showing the strength of
  a minimalistic feature-set in an embeddable scripting language.
- **Syntax:** [Coffeescript][coffeescript] and [Moonscript][moonscript] show how
  languages can be made easy on the eye by minimizing visual distractions,
  while also managing to avoid inexpressive terseness.
- **Language Design:** Although the syntax and core purpose is very different,
  [Rust][rust] had a huge impact on Koto's design. In particular Rust's
  [rich iterator support][rust-iterators] was a major influence on emphasizing
  the role of iterators in Koto.

## Tooling

### Editors

Plugins that provide Koto support are available for the following editors:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/koto-lang/koto-vscode)
- [Vim / Neovim](https://github.com/koto-lang/koto.vim)
- [Sublime Text](https://github.com/koto-lang/koto-sublime)

[Helix][helix] has built-in Koto support (since `25.01`).

### Tree-sitter

A [Tree-sitter][tree-sitter] implementation is [available here][tree-sitter-koto].
If you're using Neovim then it's easy to set up with [nvim-treesitter][nvim-treesitter].

### LSP

An implementation of the [Language Server Protocol][lsp] for Koto is
[available here][koto-ls].

## Performance

Koto's runtime is fast enough for many applications, with performance comparable to similar embedded scripting languages for Rust like [Rhai][rhai] and [Dyon][dyon].

By default, Koto uses a single-threaded runtime. The multi-threaded runtime is available via a [feature flag][api-multi-threaded], but comes with a runtime performance cost typically in the range of ~5-10%.

As an embedded language that runs in a virtual machine within an application, runtime performance is heavily affected by the way that the application is compiled. See [The Rust Performance Book][performance-book] for lots of excellent advice on how to improve performance. In particular, the choice of [allocator][allocators] used by the application should be considered.
